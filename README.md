 ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, thanks for coming. Feel free to look around, but before you do, here's two truths and a lie. See if you can guess which is which:
 - I am a UCSD graduate with a bachelors in Cognitive Science and a specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation.
 - I enjoy film making and won "Audience Favorite" in the 2017 La Jolla Film Festival.
 - I had to train my ML models for a final project in between serving tables at a restaurant because it was due that night and was taking forevor.
 
 They are actually all true. I didn't want to start our professional relationship off with a lie.
